# 1. Problem Analysis and Plan
## A. Define the Maze Navigation Problem
- Objective: What is the goal of your robot? (e.g., navigate an unknown maze from start to end)
- Constraints: List any limitations or requirements for your robot.
    - Time limit?
    - Sensor types?
    - Energy constraints?
- Create a Gantt chart to show your planning
- Create a bill of materials, including approximate prices for components

## B. Develop a Detailed Plan
### Robot Design:
- Describe the physical design of your robot.
- Sensors: (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors)
- Actuators: (e.g., motors)
- Mechanical Components: (e.g., chassis, wheels)

### Software Architecture:
- Explain how you plan to control the robot’s navigation.
- Algorithm for maze traversal
- Data flow between hardware and software

### Testing Strategy:
- Outline a strategy to test your robot’s performance.
- Different maze scenarios
- Expected outcomes for each scenario

# 2. Robot and Software Design
## A. Describe the Physical Design of the Robot
- Sensors: How will they work together?
- Actuators: How do they control the robot’s movement?
- Mechanical Components: Any unique designs or features?

## B. Propose a Clear Software Architecture
### Algorithm for Maze Navigation:
- Steps for traversing the maze
- Decision-making process (e.g., left, right, forward)

### Data Flow:
- How sensor data is processed
- How decisions are made based on this data
- Flowchart and or pseudocode

## C. Demonstrate Originality
- What makes your robot design or software unique?
- Any innovative features that could set it apart from traditional solutions.

# 3. Software Implementation and Robot Prototype
## A. Implement Algorithms for Maze Navigation
### Code Quality:
- Efficient and accurate implementation of the maze navigation algorithm.
- Clear and well-commented code
- The code should be in a private GitHub repository.
- We will go through how to copy the template in class

## B. Integrate Hardware Components
- How do you integrate your sensors, actuators, and mechanical components into a cohesive system?
- Provide a wiring diagram using Fritzing or Wokwi
- Describe any challenges faced during integration.

## C. Provide Comprehensive Documentation
- Document the software code
- Document design decisions made during implementation
- Include steps for debugging and troubleshooting

# 4. Testing of Software and Robot Operations
## A. Outline a Robust Testing Strategy
- Different maze scenarios to test
- Expected outcomes for each scenario

## B. Analyse Test Results
- Record the performance of your robot in various maze scenarios.
- Identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

# 5. Diary of Activities
## A. Maintain a Detailed Diary Record
- Document all activities related to the project
    - Design choices
    - Troubleshooting steps
    - Lessons learned
    - Example Diary

| Date | Activity |
| ---- | ---- |
| 12/3/2025 | *Created a scaffold for the documentation and prepared the rubric for the assessment* |
| 18/3/2025 | *Tried using a nested if structure for controlling the robot but the code became too complex* |
| 20/3/2025 | *Tried using a timer based motor control but it was difficult to get the distance correct* |
| 28/3/2025 | *Switched to using encoders to measure distance travelled* |
